# Pulse

Pulse is an Apache 2.0 licensed log aggregation framework built on top of Solr Cloud (Cloudera Search). It 
can be used with applications written in any language, but was built especially for improving logging
 in Apache Spark Streaming applications running on Apache Hadoop.

Pulse gives application users full text centralized search of their logs, flexible alerts on their logs,
and works with several visualization tools.

Pulse handles log lifecycle, so application developers don't have to worry about rotating or maintaining
 log indexes themselves.
